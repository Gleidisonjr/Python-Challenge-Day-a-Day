# Python Challenge Day a Day

Personal challenge: learn Python from **zero to advanced**, step by step. No fixed schedule — complete at your own pace. Covers fundamentals, core libraries, then advanced topics: **Data Science**, **Data Analytics**, **Machine Learning**, and **AI**.

---

## About this challenge

- **Personal challenge** — your rhythm, your roadmap.
- **No fixed days** — no pressure to finish by a certain date; focus on consistency and understanding.
- **Step by step** — from basics (syntax, types, control flow) to advanced (libraries, projects, real-world use).
- **Create your own roadmap** — use the suggested structure below or adapt it to your goals (e.g. more ML, more analytics, or more automation).

## Suggested roadmap (0 → advanced)

### Stage 0 — Basics
- Variables, types, operators, `print`, `input`
- Conditionals (`if` / `else` / `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`), `break` / `continue`
- Data structures: lists, tuples, dicts, sets
- List comprehensions, basic string methods

### Stage 1 — Core programming
- Functions: `def`, parameters, return, scope
- Modules and `import`
- Error handling: `try` / `except`
- Files: read/write text and CSV, `pathlib`
- Basic style: PEP 8, naming, comments

### Stage 2 — Core libraries
- **Numerical / data:** `math`, working with data in memory
- **Text and files:** `re` (regex), `json`, file handling
- **Dates and time:** `datetime`, `time`
- **System / scripts:** `os`, `sys`, simple CLI scripts

### Stage 3 — Data Science & Analytics
- **Pandas:** Series, DataFrame, read CSV, filters, `groupby`, merge, clean data
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn (plots, exploration)
- **Stats (optional):** basic statistics, hypothesis testing
- Small projects: analyze a dataset, build a simple dashboard or report

### Stage 4 — Machine Learning & AI
- **ML basics:** scikit-learn (train/test, models, metrics)
- **Classic ML:** regression, classification, clustering
- **AI / NLP (optional):** intro to NLP, or LLM APIs for small projects
- **Projects:** end-to-end pipeline: load data → preprocess → model → evaluate

You can do stages in order or jump to a stage (e.g. "only DS" or "only ML") and fill gaps in basics as you go.

## How to use this repo

1. **Pick a step** from the roadmap (or your own list).
2. **Study** — docs, courses, videos — and take notes if you like.
3. **Code** — create a folder (e.g. `day-001`, `topic-pandas-intro`) and put your scripts and experiments there.
4. **Track progress** — mark what you've done in a `ROADMAP.md` or `progress.md` (dates, topics, links).
5. **Commit often** — small commits help you see your progress and keep the challenge going.

## Summary

| Stage | Focus |
|-------|--------|
| **0** | Basics: syntax, types, control flow, data structures |
| **1** | Core: functions, modules, errors, files |
| **2** | Core libraries: math, json, datetime, os, scripts |
| **3** | Data Science & Analytics: pandas, visualization, small projects |
| **4** | Machine Learning & AI: scikit-learn, (optional) NLP/LLMs, projects |

No fixed day count. Go step by step, from zero to advanced, and build your own roadmap as you go.

Good luck with your Python Challenge Day a Day.
